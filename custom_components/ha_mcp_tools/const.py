"""Constants for the HA-MCP custom component.

The integration serves two config-entry types under one domain
(:data:`DOMAIN`), discriminated by ``entry.data[CONF_ENTRY_TYPE]``:

* ``tools`` — the privileged file / YAML services (the original component).
  Pre-existing entries carry no ``entry_type`` key, so a missing value is
  treated as ``tools`` (no migration needed).
* ``server`` — the in-process ha-mcp FastMCP server (issue #1527), exposed
  through a Home Assistant webhook.

The two halves keep their constants in separate blocks below; the ``server``
block was folded in from the former standalone ``ha_mcp_server`` integration.

# built-in ALLOWED_*_DIRS, but a custom directory can NEVER grant access to
# these. The floor is re-checked before any allow decision on every read,
# write, list, and delete, so neither a stored entry nor an in-flight one can
# punch through it.
#
# .storage holds HA's auth database (refresh/access tokens), hashed passwords,
# and every integration's cleartext credentials (core.config_entries,
# application_credentials, cloud) — including this component's OWN caller

# leak secrets and hand out the key to this component's own auth gate.

# of these fixed absolute roots — or a subdirectory of one — to the custom
# directory list; access is then enforced against the volume root exactly as a
# config-relative entry is enforced against the config dir (issue #1586).
#
# The component runs inside HA Core, so a volume is reachable only if the HA
# Core container actually mounts it (the standard HAOS/Supervised mounts are
# config/share/media/ssl/backup). An unmounted or non-existent root simply
# yields a "not found" at use time — adding it is harmless. As with the

# HA-MCP Server entry (issue #1527)
#
# Folded in from the former standalone ``ha_mcp_server`` integration. The
# "server" config-entry type runs the full ha-mcp FastMCP server in-process
# inside Home Assistant (a dedicated thread with its own asyncio loop) and
# exposes it remotely through a Home Assistant webhook, exactly like the
# webhook-proxy add-on. Creating the entry starts the server; disabling or
# removing the entry stops it. Everything below is namespaced under the shared
# ``DOMAIN`` (distinct hass.data sub-keys, distinct entry unique_id).

# PyPI distribution names. Stable ships as ``ha-mcp``; the dev channel ships as
# ``ha-mcp-dev`` — published on every master push. BOTH are installed unpinned,
# so every install / reload resolves the newest build of the selected channel
# (the component auto-updates the server rather than pinning a lockstep version
# — see ``UPDATE_CHECK_INTERVAL`` and
# ``EmbeddedServerManager._async_ensure_package``). Both wheels contain the
# *same* ``ha_mcp`` import package (publish-dev.yml only renames the
