"""ha_auth-mode OAuth indirection: component-owned endpoints in front of core.

Home Assistant core remains the authorization server — the user signs in on
core's own ``/auth/authorize`` page exactly as before. What changes is what the
CLIENT learns and calls: the unified ``{OAUTH_BASE}/authorize`` redirects the
browser into core, and ``{OAUTH_BASE}/token`` forwards the exchange
server-side. Two problems this kills:

* **Cached-endpoint stickiness.** A client that cached our advertised
  endpoints keeps reaching component-owned routes after an auth-mode switch,
  because those routes dispatch per request — it can no longer end up wedged
  on core's ``/auth/*`` (the un-retractable cache this replaces). A switch to a
  mode with different credentials can still require the client to re-authorize.
* **Cross-origin CIMD clients.** Core advertises CIMD but never fetches the
  document (core issue #176282), so clients whose redirect is not same-origin
  with their URL client_id die with "Invalid redirect URI". We validate the
  document HERE — the AS-side MUSTs from MCP 2026-07-28 client-registration —
  and hand core a translated client_id shaped to pass its long-stable
  same-origin IndieAuth rule.

SECURITY: translation grants nothing new. Core already accepts any
self-asserted ``client_id == redirect-origin`` pair (that is how claude.ai
connects today), so rewriting a VALIDATED cross-origin identity into that shape
authorizes nothing a client could not already claim by presenting the
redirect-origin as its client_id directly. Anything that fails validation is
forwarded UNCHANGED and core's own checks apply. The CIMD fetch itself is the
only outbound request: https-only, no redirects, 10 KiB cap, 5 s timeout, and
DNS pinned to pre-validated globally routable addresses (SSRF floor per the MCP
security considerations page).

MIRROR: ``homeassistant-addon-webhook-proxy-dev/mcp_proxy_dev/oauth_indirect.py``
is the near-verbatim twin of this module. Keep behavioural changes on the two
sides in step; that file's header names the pair's one intended delta (the
loopback and redirect-shape helpers come from ``oauth_legacy.py`` here and
``oauth.py`` there).

    #     core → PASSTHROUGH;
    #   none of them do → whichever was presented, it was translated to the
    #     one canonical origin → return it;
    #   some but not all → the answer depends on which was presented, and
    #     nothing here records that → UNREPRODUCIBLE.

    # which normalizes ports: ["https://h/a", "https://h:443/b"] is ONE
    # canonical origin, yet authorize on /a passes the raw client_id through
    # while /b translates (#2219 review round 3). Casefolded because the
    # authorize fast path is (core lowercases both sides there).
