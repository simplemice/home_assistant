  Simplemice Home Assistant Configuration

***

Like all other Home Assistant instances this is also a Work in Progress :D

***

This repo contains the working [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) configuration for **Casa de Ratón**. Below are links to the devices currently being used, blog posts, and other HA enthusists that provided inspiration and configs to help build this config. All of the code is free to use.

#### Casa de Ratón's Three Laws of Home Automation:

When designing Casa de Ratón's automations I have made every effort to prioritize the solution based on the following three laws. 

**First Law: Every automation or action should be the result of a passive sensor or indirect action**.

**Second Law: An automation can be triggered by voice command only when Law 1 cannot be achieved**.

**Third Law: An automation or action can be trigger by a physical switch or as the result of a direct iteraction only when Law 1 and Law 2 cannot be achieved.**
